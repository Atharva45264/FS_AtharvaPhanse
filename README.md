# 🚗 Student Commute Optimizer

The **Student Commute Optimizer** is a web-based full-stack application that helps students share rides efficiently.  
By matching students with overlapping or nearby routes, the app reduces traffic, lowers travel costs, and promotes sustainability.  
The system ensures **anonymity** using unique usernames and provides a **real-time chat feature** for communication.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
- Many students commute individually, leading to congestion and higher expenses.  
- Need a system to **match students on similar routes** and allow **private communication**.  
- Privacy is essential: students must remain **anonymous** while interacting.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Input home and destination to find possible carpool matches.  
- Show matched students on an **interactive map**.  
- Ensure **anonymity** using autogenerated usernames.  
- Enable **real-time chat** between students.

### Tools
- **VS Code** → Development environment  
- **GitHub** → Version control  
- **Postman** → API testing  
- **Draw.io / Lucidchart** → Diagrams

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Student Registration  
Student enters details → system generates unique anonymous username.  

### 2. Route Entry  
Student enters home & destination → stored in DB with **geospatial indexing**.  

### 3. Route Matching  
Backend compares routes and finds students traveling in similar directions.  

### 4. Display on Map  
Matches are shown as markers on the map (**Leaflet.js**).  

### 5. Chat  
Student clicks a marker → opens **real-time chat** (via Socket.IO).
